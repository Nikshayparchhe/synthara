# Project Title
Synthara

# Project Description
Synthara is a decentralized smart contract project built on Ethereum that enables the creation and management of synthetic assets. Users can mint synthetic tokens by providing collateral (in ETH), burn them to reclaim collateral, and query balances. This provides a basic framework for synthetic asset exposure without holding the underlying assets.

# Project Vision
To democratize access to synthetic financial instruments on the blockchain, allowing users to gain exposure to various assets (like stocks or commodities) through collateralized positions, fostering a more inclusive and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

# Key Features
- **Minting Mechanism**: Users deposit ETH as collateral to mint synthetic tokens at a 150% collateralization ratio.
- **Burning Mechanism**: Burn synthetic tokens to redeem proportional collateral.
- **Balance Query**: Easily check synthetic token balances for any address.
- **Event Emissions**: Logs for minting and burning events to track activities.

# Future Scope
- Integrate with oracles (e.g., Chainlink) for real-time asset price feeds to support multiple synthetic assets.
- Expand to full ERC20 compliance for better interoperability.
- Add liquidation mechanisms for undercollateralized positions.
- Support for multi-collateral types beyond ETH.
- User interface development for easier interaction via web apps.
